## Essential Glossary

**Comprehensive abortion care (CAC):** Provision of information, abortion management (including induced abortion and care related to pregnancy loss), and post-abortion care.

**Conscientious objection:** The practice of health-care professionals refusing to provide abortion care on the basis of personal conscience or religious belief.

**Decriminalization:** Removing abortion from all penal/criminal laws, not applying other criminal offences to abortion, and ensuring there are no criminal penalties for having, assisting with, providing information about, or providing abortion.

**Dilatation and evacuation (D&E):** Surgical technique used after 12–14 weeks of pregnancy requiring cervical preparation and evacuation using forceps and vacuum aspiration.

**Gestational age (duration of pregnancy):** The number of days or weeks since the first day of the woman's last normal menstrual period (LMP), or estimated by clinical examination or ultrasound when LMP is unknown.

**Health workers:** All people engaged in actions whose primary intent is to enhance health, including paid workers in formal health facilities and community settings.

**Incomplete abortion:** Clinical presence of an open cervical os and bleeding, whereby all products of conception have not been expelled from the uterus. Common symptoms include vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain.

**Intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD):** The intrauterine death of a fetus at any point during pregnancy.

**Mandatory waiting period:** A requirement imposed by law or policy to wait a specified amount of time between requesting and receiving abortion care.

**Medical methods of abortion (medical abortion):** Use of pharmacological agents (misoprostol ± mifepristone) to terminate a pregnancy.

**Miscarriage (spontaneous abortion):** Spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before the fetus is viable. Clinical signs include vaginal bleeding, usually with abdominal pain and cramping.

**Post-abortion care (PAC):** Provision of services after an abortion, including:
- Management of complications (moderate: incomplete abortion, continuing pregnancy, infection; severe: trauma, hemorrhage, other complications)
- Contraceptive services and linkage to other needed services
- Note: In this model, PAC access follows different logic than abortion access - legal restrictions do not apply to seeking treatment for complications

**Self-management of abortion:** Self-management of the entire process of medical abortion or one or more component steps, such as self-assessment of eligibility, self-administration of medicines without direct supervision, and self-assessment of success.

**Surgical methods of abortion:** Use of transcervical procedures for terminating pregnancy, including vacuum aspiration and dilatation and evacuation (D&E).

**Third-party authorization:** A requirement that a party other than the pregnant person (typically a parent, guardian, spouse, health worker, or judicial authority) must authorize an abortion.

**Vacuum aspiration (EVA or MVA):** Evacuation of uterine contents through a cannula attached to a vacuum source. Electric (EVA) uses an electric pump; manual (MVA) uses a hand-activated 60ml aspirator.
