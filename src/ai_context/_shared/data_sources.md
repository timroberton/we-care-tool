# Data Sources and Quality

Baseline parameters combine multiple sources:

**Primary data sources:**
- Unintended pregnancies, abortion demand, family planning: WHO-Guttmacher estimates
- Facility readiness (workforce, commodities): Harmonized Health Facility Assessment (HHFA) or similar facility surveys where available
- Access barriers (legal, distance, cost): Country-specific surveys, administrative data, or regional estimates

**Data hierarchy:**
- Country-specific data used when available
- Regional defaults from peer-reviewed literature when country data unavailable
- Expert assumptions by country teams for remaining gaps

**Data quality considerations:**
- Baseline values vary in quality, recency, and reliability
- Some indicators rely on assumptions rather than empirical measurement
- Users should interpret results as exploratory insights, not predictions
