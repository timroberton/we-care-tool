# Background

This tool implements a scenario modeling framework based on the WHO Abortion Care Guideline, Second edition (2025), which provides consolidated recommendations on abortion service delivery, safety standards, and legal/policy frameworks to protect women's health and prevent unsafe abortions.

## Key Evidence from WHO

- Globally, 25 million unsafe abortions occur annually, representing a major preventable cause of maternal mortality
- Where abortion is most restricted, only 1 in 4 abortions are safe, compared to nearly 9 in 10 where abortion is broadly legal
- Safe abortion requires: use of recommended method, appropriate to the gestational age, and by someone with the necessary skills
- Recommended methods include: medication abortion (misoprostol ± mifepristone), vacuum aspiration, dilation & evacuation

## Critical Barriers to Safe Abortion Care

Research across multiple countries reveals consistent patterns that explain why legal access alone doesn't ensure safety:

**Legal context does not guarantee access:**
- In Zambia, despite liberal abortion laws, 70% of abortions remain unsafe due to low awareness of legality, stigma, and provider shortages
- Ethiopia's 2006 law expansion resulted in only 27% of abortions being safe by 2008
- Even in South Africa with legal services, women seek unsafe options due to stigma, confidentiality concerns, and lack of knowledge

**Provider barriers:**
- Gatekeeping requirements (e.g., requiring approval from multiple physicians) severely limit access even where legal
- Provider shortages: In contexts like Zambia, fewer than 60 specialist physicians served 15 million people
- Stigma enables provider extortion through unofficial payments, knowing women are unlikely to report
- Judgmental provider attitudes lead to abuse and denial of care

**Systemic access challenges:**
- Complex care-seeking pathways increase costs and delays, especially for induced abortion complications versus spontaneous
- Women often consult multiple providers (averaging 3+) before finding competent care
- Information gaps about legality and available services, particularly among adolescents
- Distance, cost, and legal barriers compound for marginalized populations

**Post-abortion care gaps:**
- Up to 40% of women experiencing complications do not receive sufficient care
- Self-induced abortion at home (medication, traditional methods) is common where access is limited
- Provider competency issues result in preventable complications requiring hospitalization

**Key social determinants:**
- Stigma at individual, provider, and community levels
- Lack of accurate information about legal status and service availability
- Economic barriers (costs, unofficial payments)
- Geographic access challenges
- Age and socioeconomic vulnerabilities

These barriers interact and compound, creating trajectories where even those with legal rights face unsafe conditions. Effective interventions must address multiple barriers simultaneously—improving legal frameworks, provider availability and attitudes, information access, and reducing stigma—to translate policy into safe care delivery.
