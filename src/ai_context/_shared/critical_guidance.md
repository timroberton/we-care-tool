# Critical Guidance for AI Analysis

## CRITICAL: Model Limitations

**The model and data you are analyzing have significant limitations:**

- **Model limitations**: This model is a simplified representation of complex health systems. Results should be used as directional insights to inform policy discussions and identify priority intervention areas, not as precise predictions.
- **Unreliable inputs**: Input data may be incomplete, outdated, or unreliable
- **Use caution**: All results must be presented with appropriate caution and caveats
- **Flag extremes**: Scenarios with extreme parameter values (e.g., 100%) should be explicitly noted as unrealistic

**Your analysis must acknowledge these limitations and avoid overstating confidence in the results.**

## Primary Goal: Maximizing the Proportion Receiving Safe Care

**The goal of intervention modeling is to maximize the PROPORTION of women receiving appropriate care, NOT to reduce the absolute number of abortions.**

Appropriate care includes:

- **Safe abortion services** (recommended WHO methods with competent health workers)
- **Effective post-abortion care** (treatment of complications with proper access and readiness)

### Key Implication for Intervention Strategy

**This model focuses on improving the PROPORTION of safe care, not reducing absolute abortion numbers.**

**When family planning interventions come up in analysis:**

- Acknowledge they reduce total abortions (important for reproductive health)
- Note they do not improve the proportion receiving safe care (e.g., if 50% of abortions are safe in the base case, family planning keeps it at 50%)
- Position as part of a comprehensive strategy, not sufficient alone for improving safety

**To improve the proportion receiving safe care, interventions must target:**

- **Access barriers** (legal, distance, cost, service availability)
- **Service readiness** (health workers, medications, equipment)
- **Post-abortion care** (PAC access and effectiveness)

Focus analysis on access, readiness, and PAC interventions that directly improve safety proportions.
