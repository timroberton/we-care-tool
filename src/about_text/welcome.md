# We Care

We Care is a scenario modeling tool to help policymakers analyze abortion care access and facility readiness, and understand the impact of health systems interventions on safety outcomes and population health.

> **This tool is designed for exploration and planning.** The model provides a simplified representation of complex health systems. Results should be used as directional insights to inform policy discussions and identify priority intervention areas, not as precise predictions.

## Evidence-Based Framework

The tool implements WHO recommendations on safe abortion service delivery, reflecting key evidence:

- Globally, 25 million unsafe abortions occur annually, representing a major preventable cause of maternal mortality.
- Where abortion is most restricted, only 1 in 4 abortions are safe, compared to nearly 9 in 10 where abortion is broadly legal.
- Safe abortion requires: use of recommended method, appropriate to the gestational age, and by someone with the necessary skills.

## Key Features

- **Scenario Modeling** – Compare baseline conditions against multiple intervention scenarios
- **Safety-Focused Results** – Track abortion outcomes across safe, less safe, and least safe categories
- **Interactive Visualizations** – Charts, flow diagrams, and comprehensive tables
- **AI Assistant** – Natural language analysis and report generation using AI
- **Privacy** – All data stored locally in your browser

Model upstream interventions to improve access (legal, geographic, financial) and facility readiness to understand their downstream effects on abortion safety outcomes and post-abortion care.
