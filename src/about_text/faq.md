# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

The We Care: User Guide and instructional videos are good resources to answer many common questions regarding use and functionality of the tool. Other common questions are answered below:

#### **Where does the default data in the tool come from?**

The intention is for countries to find and use their own data, and this is what we suggest as a best practice. The default parameters in the tool are a starting point only, and can be useful estimates for indicators where quantitative data is sparse. The default data comprises regional estimates (Appendices A and B), in addition to country specific HHFA data, where available. For more information on data sources, see the data sources section of this document.

#### **How can I update my country parameters?**

Using the tool requires a set of numbers for the base case and scenarios. You can update your country specific parameters directly in the platform, or by downloading/uploading the parameters CSV file as outlined in the user guide section of this document.

#### **How do I save my sources?**

The tool provides a way to input notes and annotation, as a data source description. You can record your sources for each indicator in the associated ‘source’ box (see user guide section for more detail). Once you have input this information, it will be downloaded as part of the parameters CSV file, as well as input as context for the AI assistant. These sources are purely for keeping track of data, and are not used in the calculations.

#### **How can I export my sources?**

You can export sources through the CSV file, or have the AI assistant create a source table or citation list for you, once you have input sources into the associated ‘source’ box for each indicator.

#### **Can I collaborate on a project with multiple team members at the same time?**

You can collaborate with team members when working on projects, however the platform will save updates and changes made to your browser only (in other words, only to the version you are working on). You can download parameter files to share amongst team members or to create a backup, and share reports and visualizations by exporting these from the platform (into Word or as PNG images).

#### **Where do the definitions come from in the ‘Definitions’ tab?**

The definitions concerning required commodities and equipment for safe, less safe, and least safe services were developed in collaboration with the WHO Prevention of Unsafe Abortion team, in line with the WHO Abortion Care Guideline recommendations.

#### **Where does the complication rate data come from in the ‘Definitions’ tab?**

It is difficult to appropriately define complication rates for all facility-based and out-of-facility services due to lack of empirical data. The data sources for complication rates included in the model are referenced in Appendices C and D, and the calculation details for estimates used are outlined in the model methodology section of this document.

#### **How do I use the AI assistant?**

Make sure you have pulled up the ‘AI’ tab from the bottom of the page, if it is not already open. Once the ‘AI’ tab is open, you can use the AI assistant by typing your query into the chat box, and pressing ‘submit’.

#### **Can I change parameters in default scenarios?**

Yes, you can! Simply adjust the slider bar like you would when adjusting the base case values. You will see your changes reflected in the platform.

#### **Can I add a new default scenario?**

At this point in time, it is not possible to add new default scenarios. However, you can create a custom scenario to model exactly the scenario you are interested in exploring, or modifying a set default scenario to better suit your research question.

#### **How were the default scenarios decided?**

The default scenarios currently in the tool reflect some of the scenarios that may have the most significant positive impact on increasing access to safe abortion services. These include improving facility access and readiness, and increasing preference for facility-based care. These scenarios, along with the health system building block default scenarios, reflect how myriad public health interventions could yield increased access to safe abortion services.
