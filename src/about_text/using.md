# Using the Tool

> **Important**: This model provides a simplified representation of abortion care pathways and does not reflect the full complexity of real-world health systems. Input data may be incomplete or unreliable. Use results as insights for exploration and planning, not as definitive predictions.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a Project

Start by creating a new project to organize your analysis. Each project contains:

- One **baseline scenario** representing current conditions
- Multiple **intervention scenarios** modeling alternative policies or programs
- Parameters you can adjust independently for each scenario

### 2. Configure Your Baseline

Set parameters representing the current context using available evidence:

- **Family planning** – Met need, method effectiveness, unmet need for contraception
- **Abortion seeking** – Proportion seeking abortion among those with unintended pregnancies, preference for facility-based care
- **Facility access** – Legal restrictions, geographic distance, service availability, financial barriers
- **Out-of-facility access** – Geographic and financial barriers to facility-based services; accessibility of out-of-facility care (safe, less safe and least safe)
- **Service readiness** – Component availability (competent providers, medications, equipment, supplies)

### 3. Create Intervention Scenarios

Model interventions by adjusting WHO health system building blocks:

- **Legal/policy**: Removing legal restrictions on access to safe abortion care
- **Service availability**: Expanding access to safe abortion care, including care for abortion complications
- **Workforce**: Increasing the availability and competency of providers of abortion and post-abortion care
- **Commodities**: Ensuring medication availability (misoprostol, mifepristone, pain management)
- **Financial**: Reducing cost barriers through public financing
- **Combined**: Multi-component interventions addressing multiple barriers

### 4. Analyze Results Across Safety Categories

Review outcomes in four integrated views:

- **Table Tab** – Detailed metrics for all stages of the model
- **Charts Tab** – Compare safety outcomes (safe/less safe/least safe) across scenarios
- **Flow Tab** – Visualize pathways from unintended pregnancy through access barriers to final outcomes
- **Reports Tab** – AI-generated analysis with embedded visualizations

### 5. Use the AI Assistant

Ask questions in natural language:

- "Compare the impact of removing cost barriers vs removing legal barriers"
- "Create a report analyzing safety outcomes across all scenarios"
- "What would happen if we increased medication availability to 90%?"

The AI understands the model methodology and WHO guidelines to provide evidence-based interpretations.
